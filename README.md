# AVDB-4RC
The dataset AVDB-4RC (Audio/Video Database for Rainfall Classification) contains digital audio/video sequences recorded for seven different levels of precipitation intensity.
In particular, the database presents a set of audio sequences containing the acoustic timbre produced by the rain and video sequences containing rain videos, both in seven different intensities, i.e. “No rain”, “Weak rain”, “Moderate rain”, “Heavy rain” and “Very Heavy rain”, "Shower rain" and "Cloudburst rain".
